Linked Lists Lab 2
A program that determines whether or not a patron is in our library system.
Our library system is a linked list data structure.

- Construct a linked list structure
      - Node features: name, Library card, Street, City, Zip, next
      - Linked List features: head, load method, inList method, add method,
      print method

- User interface method
      - void, no param
      - ask for name // scanner
      - call inList method and return a statement saying whether or not they are
      in the list

- add method
      - adds things to the linked list

- print method
      - iterates through llist, printing all nodes

- load method
      - void, no param
      - create 8 instances of the Node class
      - add the 8 nodes to the list
      - PATRONS IN LIST:
              - Pam
              - Jim
              - Kevin
              - Michael
              - Dwight
              - Angela
              - Andy
              - Meridth

- inList method
      - void, @param name
      - iterate through list with current_node.next
      - check list.name
      - if inputted name == list.name, print info
      - if current_node == null, print they are not in the list
