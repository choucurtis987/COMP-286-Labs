Recursion Lab 4
PROMPT: (1) Write a recursive function that returns true if the input string is a palindrome,
that is, a word that is the same when reversed. Examples of palindromes are “deed”, ”rotor”.
A word is a palindrome if the first and last letters match and the rest of the string is a palindrome.


- make a boolean method that determines if a word is a palindrome
      - make all letters lowercase to battle case sensitivity

- checking if a word is a palindrome:
      - check to see if first char of string matches last char of string
      - if they match remove the first and last char
      - pass the new string into the function again

- BASE CASES:
      - if string.length() is equal to 1, return true
      - if string.length() is equal to 2, and last and first char match, return true

- SPECIAL CASE:
      - if string is equal to 0, return false
