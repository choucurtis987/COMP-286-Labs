A program that designs and displays the schedule for when a library should
release a book onto their shelves. The program utilizes a linked list data
structure and Stack ADT.

- Utilize a stack to push and pop books from the list
      - Push = print title and author
      - Pop = print title, release month, alternate month

      - methods of the stack include: push, pop, isEmpty, peek, print list

- Have method that creates the linked list with nodes pre-made

- Have a push all method that pushes all books to the stack

- Have a pop all method that pushes all books of the stack
